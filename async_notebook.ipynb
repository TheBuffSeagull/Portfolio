    "# What I learned about async and asyncio\n",
    "I wanted to learn another method besides **multiprocessing** to do many things at the same time. This isn't to say that async is able to do two things at once. Instead, the program can choose to pass over anything that takes a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great example of this is 2-factor authentication(2FA). When you get sent a text to prove who you are, the company who sent you the text starts up an \"async\" task or asyncronious task. This task is simply just waiting for the confirmation that you entered the correct numbers and then it lets you into your account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up until the point where a computer program needs to do something, it would be extremely wasteful to have a computer sit waiting while not doing anything else. This is why we invented __[coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#:~:text=Coroutines%20are%20computer%20program%20components,iterators%2C%20infinite%20lists%20and%20pipes.)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote:\n",
    "> _Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes._\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to write an example program where we simulate a 2FA system waiting for people to enter their private code. I'm not going to create the actual texting/emailing system for that in this write-up as those topics deserve their own Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write-up Conclusion:\n",
    "If you have code in your program that is just waiting for a result async is one of the best solutions you can find. \n",

    "- This is a very basic wait function that doesn't account for people not entering their codes at all. Normally, in circumstances where a user doesn't reply, the async event will raise a **timeout** error. I usually just use the exception itself to let the user know they ran out of time.
